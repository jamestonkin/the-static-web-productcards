        <p class="description">Our luxurious beard oil is made from acorn nuts taken from baby squirrels. These acorns have been stored by the mother squirrels at our squirrel farm all fall in preparation for winter. Just before the mother squirrel's acorns are given to their young we snatch them up and press them into this wonderful oil. Our beard oil not only moisturizes your beard, it will grow a full beard if you are beardless in two days, guaranteed.</p>
